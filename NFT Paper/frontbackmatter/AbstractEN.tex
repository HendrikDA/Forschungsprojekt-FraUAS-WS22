	\chapter*{Abstract}
	Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have risen in popularity in recent years. While they are commonly used as a means of financial investment, they also have the potential to be leveraged to fulfill other use cases. One such use case is serving as a supplement to tracking user data. This research uses an example use case to demonstrate how NFTs can be used to gather user data. This data can then be used to serve targeted ads to the user. This paper walks through an example case study and how proves that this is possible with a JavaScript example. The results of this paper suggest that this is possible with the current technology. However, the problem lies in the fact that wide-spread adoption of NFTs is currently not possible because of hindering factors such as a high entry barrier to the blockchain and high gas prices to interact with it. Because of this, it is possible to supplement data gathering with NFTs, but they do not fully replace how cookies are conventionally used.
