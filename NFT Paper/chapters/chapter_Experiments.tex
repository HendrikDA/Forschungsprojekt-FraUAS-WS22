% Sharing Your Wallet's Content
\subsection{Privacy - Sharing Your Wallet's Content}
\ref{sec:results:walletContent}
It might be a problem who an individual shows their wallet to, i.e. with which platforms a user connects their wallet to. Because an online store receives the public address of a user, and can thus see the contents of their wallet, certain privacy issues may arise with single-sign on.

This may force users to own several wallets. Each time a user connects to an online store, they would have to think about which wallet they want to use, meaning which wallet's content they want to share with the website they are connecting to.

\subsection{High Entry Barrier}
\label{sub:results:barrier}
Todo: How is the high entry barrier of NFTs going to influence the wide spread use of tracking via NFTs? It might not be very practical to track users this way.

\section{Application Potential}
\label{sec:results:potential}
Go into detail of what potential use cases may arise from NFTs being used in this way. For example, if I buy a Werder Ticket and that gets saved into my wallet, and I then get a hotel somewhere in Bremen, they may see that I'm there for the game and may give me a discount or something. The prerequisite for something like that is that everyone supports NFTs.
