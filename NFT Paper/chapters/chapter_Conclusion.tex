This paper is just the first step in research towards the power of NFTs, other than leveraging them as a financial investment. It only scratches the surface of this topic and a deep-dive into the subject matter would require both more time and dedication.

More research in this subject area would be interesting to see. There are many questions still open at the end of this writing, such as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{When considering the high gas prices associated with the blockchain, what does the price of the product need to be to make the blockchain transaction profitable?}
	\item \textit{What markets could profit off of leveraging NFTs and Wallets to collect data?}
	\item \textit{An advantage of NFTs and Wallets is that they are new and are thus not as heavily regulated. How could new privacy laws and laws in general influence the collection of data using NFTs and Wallets?}
	\item \textit{What demographic is this applicable to?}
\end{itemize}

Obviously this paper is not able to cover all of the above points. Many questions are still open, as there is a research gap surrounding this subject. Deep diving into any of the above subjects would achieve very interesting results which may have a big impact on the future of the web.

A Master's Thesis would allow for the necessary environment to dive into any of these subjects in more detail.
